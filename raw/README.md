One of the objectives of this README, beyond easy access of navigation, is to add additional information about the folders beyond innate folder structure.

    Ex. You may find a sticker from a DEFCON Group at an event like a Security BSides.
    Instead of being placed in the general DEFCON Groups folder, the sticker will live
    in the location/event folder it was obtained.

It is also inevitable that due to mail sharing, DCSTICKERSWAP, and maybe even a lack of knowledge about the origins of a sticker, location or event will be a primary source of information about the sticker.

    Ex. You find a Hak5 sticker at the DCSTICKERSWAP during DEFCON 27.
    This sticker might have been released in 2017, but the only verifiable information
    you have is that you received the sticker at DCSTICKERSWAP during DEFCON 27.

As always, your contributions are awesome and try your best to include as much information as you have.
