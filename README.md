# awesome-stickers
A collection of scanned Hacker / Information Security / DevOps Stickers from various conferences.

## Contributing
Please provide pictures of stickers with a **minimum 300 DPI image** (higher resolutions greatly appreciated). You do not need to photoshop the background out from your submission, but we are grateful to those who do so! Please try to take a clear picture, straight on, without shadows cast over the sticker.

When you name your contribution, use your commit message to add context, but otherwise please use the following naming format **YEAR**-**Type**-**Conference**, where *Type* might be:
- InfoSec
- Hacker
- DevOps
- Company / Product Logo
- Meme
- etc. (be mildy creative, but err toward descriptive)

Any additional details about the sticker, back-story, or where it was acquired are great to include.

While this project is not run by [@dcstickerswap](https://twitter.com/dcstickerswap), they are a collaborator and source of sticker information.

Thank you!
